# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** The plugin architecture and AI integration must work from day one -- modularity and intelligence are not bolt-ons.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation Types and Geometry Core

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Foundation Types and Geometry Core)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing phase 1
Last activity: 2026-02-15 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (slicecore-geo polygon types and boolean ops)

Progress: [##........] 6% (2/4 plans in phase 1, 2/~36 overall)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.28 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01    | 2     | 17min | 8.5min   |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (8min), 01-02 (9min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Integer coordinates (i64 Coord, COORD_SCALE) must be locked in Phase 1 before any algorithms
- [Roadmap]: Vertical slice (Phase 3) proves pipeline before horizontal expansion
- [Roadmap]: Plugin system (Phase 7) deferred until trait interfaces stabilize through Phases 4-6
- [Roadmap]: API-06 (C FFI) and API-07 (Python bindings) excluded -- conflicts with PROJECT.md "Out of Scope"
- [01-01]: Coord = i64 with COORD_SCALE=1_000_000 (nanometer precision, +/-9.2e12 mm range)
- [01-01]: Point2/Point3 PartialEq uses EPSILON (1e-9) approximate comparison
- [01-01]: Vec normalize of zero vector returns zero vector (not panic)
- [01-01]: BBox from_points returns Option (None for empty slice)
- [01-01]: Matrix4x4 stored row-major, inverse returns None for singular matrices
- [01-02]: clipper2-rust v1.0.0 for boolean ops and offsetting (pure Rust, i64 coords, WASM-compatible)
- [01-02]: ValidPolygon caches signed area and winding; from_raw_parts is pub(crate) for boolean/offset output
- [01-02]: Boolean ops use NonZero fill rule; degenerate result paths silently filtered
- [01-02]: Winding convention: CCW = outer boundary (positive area), CW = hole (negative area)
- [01-02]: Offset collapse returns empty Vec (not error) when inward offset exceeds half-width

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API-06 and API-07 scope conflict needs user resolution (REQUIREMENTS.md vs PROJECT.md disagree)
